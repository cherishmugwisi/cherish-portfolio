# Cherish Mugwisi Portfolio (Frontend Only)

A simple 4-page portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Pages:
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — About
- `projects.html` — Project links (includes 2 fictional projects: *TengaNow* and *Shongedza ltd*)
- `place-order.html` — Form page (Place Order)

## How to run locally
Just open any of the `.html` files in your browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (steps)
1. Create a new GitHub repository, e.g. `cherish-portfolio`.
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo (or `git init`, commit, and push).
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder. Click **Save**.
6. After a minute, your site will be live at:
   `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/cherish-portfolio/`

> Tip: Test the contact form locally; since this is a frontend-only demo, it saves orders to your browser `localStorage` and logs them to the console.

## Customize
- Update text (name, bio) inside each HTML page.
- Replace images in `assets/images/` with your own screenshots.
- Edit colors in `assets/style.css`.
